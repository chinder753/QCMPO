 Matrix Product Operators (MPO) for two-body Hamiltonians
===========================================================

The function to use is directHmpo in mpo_direct.py, where an example can be also found.
It allows to construct MPO for two-body H for any grouping of orbitals (specified by partition of spin orbitals), e.g.,

365    k = 10
366    h1e,h2e = genRandomH(k)
367    partition = [[0,1,2,3],[4,5],[6,7],[8,9]]
368    ngroups,wfacs = directHmpo(h1e,h2e,partition,isym=0)
369    print ngroups
370    for i in range(ngroups):
371       print wfacs[i].shape

The output is a list of W[k] for MPO.
